# ILS-AND-TABU-SEARCH-IMPLEMENTATION-FOR-BIN-PACKING-PROBLEM

Iterative local search and Tabu search implementation for the one-dimensional bin packing problem

The one-dimensional bin packing problem is a classic optimization problem in which a set of items of dierent
sizes must be packed into a minimum number of bins, each with a fixed capacity. The goal is to minimize the
number of bins used while ensuring that no bin exceeds its capacity. In mathematical terms, the problem can
be formulated as follows: Given a set of items with sizes a1, a2, ..., an, where each item has a positive size, and
unlimited number of bins with a fixed capacity C, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins required to
pack all the items such that the total size of the items in each bin does not exceed C. The problem is known
to be NP-hard, which means that nding an optimal solution for large instances is dicult and time-consuming.
Therefore, various approximation algorithms and heuristics have been developed to solve the problem eciently
in practice.

In this implementation we evaluate the eectiveness of single point searches namely, Iterated Local Search
and Tabu Search to solve the problem.

We use 5 datasets each containing a number of problem instances obtained from the 1-dimensional bin packing problem domain. We perform the following tasks : 
1. Develop a program that uses the Iterated Local Search to solve all the instances of the 1-dimensional bin problem contained in each dataset
2. Develop a program that uses the Tabu Search Algorithm to solve all the instances of the 1-dimensional bin
problem contained in each dataset. (9 marks)

I have also attached a report that includes a technical specification of the two programs including the algorithm configuration and A critical comparative analysis of the two algorithms on the bin packing problem.
